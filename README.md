# IrohEx
![2000 node iroh swarm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adiibanez/iroh_ex/refs/heads/main/media/iroh_swarm.jpg)

Attempt at a seamless Iroh integration via Elixir + Rustler.
Elixir orchestrates and manages concurrency, while Rust handles low-level networking, swarm-forming, encryption, and performance-critical tasks.
Currently includes only basic Iroh functionality â€” with randomized PKI and gossip topic assignment.

requires ulimit -n X configuration suitable to the number of nodes in the swarm. Default on osx is 256. This configuration isn't integrated in livebook at the moment. Starting many nodes ( thousands ) can upset your network stack and / or router.
